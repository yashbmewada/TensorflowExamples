Simple and Descriptive Tensorflow Examples

This example shows how to use Tensorflow gradient descent optimizer to fit a curve.

It tries to learn from random datapoints with the corresponding y coordinate to fit a line of the form y=mx+b.

Every single iteration tries to calculate the mean squared error and reduce it to fit as closely to points as possible.

This example can be used to demonstrate rudimentary concept of machine learning - Learning by curve fitting.
